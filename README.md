# ✈️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Flight Aware  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on **Flight Aware** data to uncover insights related to airline performance, flight delays, trends, and factors affecting flight operations. The analysis is performed using **Python** with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

```

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Flight-Aware-EDA.git
   cd Flight-Aware-EDA
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Jupyter Notebook**  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open `Exploratory_Data_Analaysis_Flight_Aware.ipynb` to explore the dataset.

## 📊 Data Exploration Steps  
The EDA process includes:  
1. **Loading the dataset**  
2. **Handling missing values & data cleaning**  
3. **Feature Engineering**  
4. **Visualizing flight patterns & delays**  
5. **Analyzing factors affecting flight operations**  

## 📈 Key Visualizations  
- **Flight delay distribution**  
- **Airline-wise performance comparison**  
- **Time-series analysis of flights**  
- **Weather impact on flight delays**  

## 🚀 Running the Analysis  
To load and explore the dataset, run:  
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("flight_data.csv")
df.info()
df.describe()
```

To visualize delays:  
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.histplot(df['delay_minutes'], bins=50, kde=True)
plt.title("Flight Delay Distribution")
plt.show()
```

## 📌 Observations & Insights  
- Peak flight delays occur during **specific hours of the day**.  
- **Weather conditions** and **airline carriers** significantly impact flight punctuality.  
- Certain **airports** exhibit higher delays due to congestion.
